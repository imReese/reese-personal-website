# This file tells GitHub Pages to skip Jekyll processing
# and serve the files as static assets directly

# The presence of this file in the repository root
# disables Jekyll processing on GitHub Pages

# This is necessary for Next.js static export deployments
# that don't require Jekyll's Ruby-based processing

# Static files are served as-is without Jekyll transformation
